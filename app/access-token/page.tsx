Dear [IT Support / Canvas Administrator's Name],

I am a student at [Your University Name] and recently downloaded the Canvo app to help me stay organized with my coursework. I often find Canvas overwhelming and difficult to keep track of all my assignments, deadlines, and course information in one place.

Canvo promises to simplify this process by automatically organizing my tasks and deadlines, but it requires access to my Canvas access token. Unfortunately, I do not currently have access to generate an access token from my account.

I am requesting your assistance in enabling access token generation for my account so I can use Canvo to:
- Automatically sync all my assignments, quizzes, and deadlines
- Receive smart reminders and visual task calendars
- Stay on top of my coursework and reduce stress

I understand that access token usage is subject to security and policy considerations. I want to assure you that:
- The app will only access data tied to my personal Canvas account
- No third-party data will be collected or shared
- The access token will be stored securely and used solely for academic purposes
- I am happy to follow any additional guidelines or submit a formal request if needed

If student access is restricted, I would greatly appreciate your advice on whether there's an alternative pathâ€”such as faculty sponsorship or a sandbox environmentâ€”that would allow me to move forward responsibly.

Thank you for considering my request. If you have any questions about Canvo, you can visit https://canvo.vercel.app, contact support at canvohelp@gmail.com, or use the support page at https://canvo.vercel.app/support.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Student ID]
[Your Email Address]
[Your Degree Program / Faculty]
